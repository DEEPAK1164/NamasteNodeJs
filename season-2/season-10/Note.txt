Authentication JWT and Cookiess
//read about cookie hijacking
install cookie parser
send dummy cookie to user
-create dummy get/profile api and check if you get cookie back
-install json webtoken
-in login api , after email and password validation , create a JWT token and send it to user.
in cookie 
-read the cookie inside your profile api and find the logged in user
-write userAuth middleware
-add userAuth middleware in profile api and a new sendConnectionRequest
-set the expiry of jwt token and cookie for 1 day

Imp Concept: there is something called mongoose schema method
as we have user schema which defines user so can attach some methods to schema
that is applicable to all users these methods are helper methods
that is very closely related to user for example when I try to login
I create jwt token and storing it into the jwt payload
so this method is very closely related to user
as every user will have different methods to signing the token
so instead of signing the token inside post/login api I can get the token from user schema method
so we can offload jwt creation logic into user schema handler method.
and these are kind helper method only.

-create userschema method to get jwt
-create userSchema method to comparePassword(passwordInputByUser)

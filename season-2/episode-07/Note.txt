Difference between JSON and JavaScript
JavaScript Object: A JavaScript object is a data
 structure that allows you to store key-value pairs.
 It's used to organize and manipulate data in JavaScript programs.

 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): JSON is a lightweight data-interchange 
 format that is used to store and transfer data. 
 Itâ€™s essentially a string representation of a JavaScript object, 
 used for communication between servers and web applications.
